Machine Learning Projects
#This project is based on online reviews classification
#The reviews are classified as positive or negative , basically analysing the sentiment of the reviews
# Multiclass classification is also implemented to predict the ratings between 1 to 5
#Natural language processing combined with predictive modeling is used.
#The concepts of NLP used in this project are
#Tokenization, Stemming, Space and punctuation removal, StopWords removal (Here stopwords were not removed - because "not" or"negations" hold prime importance in reviews and feedback) Count Vectorization and Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency
